# Kitty Cat Clicky Game

## Overview 
The Kitty Cat Clicky Game is a React app that tests a user's memory for which cat images they have already clicked on.Using components and the state of the components, the game will record which cards have already been clicked on and update the user's score for each time they click on a cat they have not yet chosen. When a user clicks on one that they have already chosen, the score resets and the user gets the chance to play again. This happens at the end of the game as well if they correctly choose all 12 images.
